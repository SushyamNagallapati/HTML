In computer we have 2 types of images, they are;
1. Raster Images
2. Vector Images

### 1. Raster Images
--> Raster images are made up of pixels.
--> They come from cameras/ scanners.
--> Formats: JPG (Mostly used), Gif and PNG (Used for animations and tranparency), WEBP.
--> More pixels = larger file size.
--> Images look blurry when enlarged.


### 2. Vector Images
--> Created in software like Adobe Illustrator.
--> Formats: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).
--> Images look sharp at any size, because images are made up of mathematical vectors and not by pixels.
