<!-- In HTML we have two types of images, they are;

1. Content Images
2. Background Images

Each imgage element should have two attributes, they are;
1. src (source) - This is the path to the image.
2. alt (alternative text) - This is the text that will be displayed if the image cannot be loaded. And also it is used by screen readers to describe the image to visually impaired users. 

We get a blurry image when we set the width to 100vw because the image is stretched to fit the width of the viewport.

.meal {
  width: 100vw;
